## 📚 How It Works

### 1. **Meeting Logs:**
Document each meeting with essential details including date, time, participants, subject, and other relevant aspects. Ensure that discussed points, agreed actions, and subsequent steps are neatly organized.

Different meetings have different dynamics. Here are a few variations to inspire you:

**Project Update Meeting**:

```
- **Date & Time**: [Date & Time]
- **Participants**: Project Managers, Team Leads
- **Subject**: Monthly Project Update
- **Points Discussed**: 
    - Status of ongoing tasks
    - Challenges faced by teams
- **Agreed Actions**: 
    - Allocate additional resources to Task A
    - Schedule a follow-up meeting with Vendor X
- **Next Steps**: 
    - Update the project timeline
    - Inform stakeholders about changes
```

**Software Tool Onboarding**:

```
- **Date & Time**: [Date & Time]
- **Participants**: IT Department, User Representatives
- **Subject**: Onboarding New CRM Tool
- **Points Discussed**: 
    - Tool functionalities
    - Integration with existing systems
- **Agreed Actions**: 
    - Conduct training sessions
    - Set up user accounts
- **Next Steps**: 
    - Test tool for two weeks
    - Gather feedback from early users
```

Use these examples as starting points and modify them according to your specific meeting contexts.

### 2. **Related Entities:**
"Entities" serve as a concept to group and categorize frequently mentioned elements. Using emojis can make it easy to visually identify the type of entity.

*Examples:*
- 😁 **People**: Individuals related to the meeting.
- 🏢 **Companies**: Mentioned or related organizations.
- 🗓️ **Projects**: Discussed or impacted projects.
- 📊 **BI Dashboards**: Referenced metrics or panels.
- ☁️ **Environments**: Mentioned tech environments (e.g., Stage, Production).
- 📲 **Software**: Discussed tools or platforms.

#### **🔍 Consistency in Entity Naming**:

To enhance clarity and prevent potential confusion, it's pivotal to maintain consistent names for entities throughout the log. In cases where an entity is recognized by several names or acronyms, settle on a main label and append an 'also known as' (aka) footnote at its first introduction. This strategy ensures that every participant and reader can effortlessly identify the entities being discussed.

*Example:*
- **🏢 ACME Business** (aka: ACME-b)
- **😁 John Doe** (aka: JD)

By adopting this method, we not only promote transparent communication but also accommodate the sporadic use of shorthand or alternate terminologies that might surface during meetings.
### 3. **Markdown as the Foundation:**
OpenMeetingLog utilizes Markdown for structuring the records. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that simplifies content formatting. It's widely recognized and easy to use, making the records both human-readable and suitable for various platforms.

### 4. 🚀 Getting Started

Whether you're new to documenting meetings or just looking for a structured approach, OpenMeetingLog provides a seamless way to keep track of your discussions. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### 1. **Step-by-Step Guidance**:

**a. Setup**: Start by setting up a dedicated folder or directory where you'll save all your meeting logs. This ensures that over time, as you accumulate logs, they're all in one place for easy access.

**b. Decide on Entities**: Before you begin, think about the common entities that will be frequently mentioned in your meetings. This might be team members, projects, tools, etc. Having a list beforehand helps in consistent tagging.

**c. Begin Documenting**: After each meeting, set aside a few minutes to document the key points using the OpenMeetingLog format. The sooner you do this after a meeting, the fresher the details are in your mind.

**d. Periodic Review**: It's a good practice to review your logs once every month (or a period that suits your needs) to ensure all information is still relevant and to see if any patterns emerge from your meetings.

### 2. **Templates**:

For your convenience, here's a template you can copy and use immediately for your meeting logs:
