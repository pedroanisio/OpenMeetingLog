## 📚 How It Works

### 1. **Meeting Logs:**
Document each meeting with essential details including date, time, participants, subject, and other relevant aspects. Ensure that discussed points, agreed actions, and subsequent steps are neatly organized.

*Example:*
```
- **Date & Time**: ...
- **Participants**: ...
- **Subject**: ...
- **Points Discussed**: ...
- **Agreed Actions**: ...
- **Next Steps**: ...
```

### 2. **Related Entities:**
"Entities" serve as a concept to group and categorize frequently mentioned elements. Using emojis can make it easy to visually identify the type of entity.

*Examples:*
- 😁 **People**: Individuals related to the meeting.
- 🏢 **Companies**: Mentioned or related organizations.
- 🗓️ **Projects**: Discussed or impacted projects.
- 📊 **BI Dashboards**: Referenced metrics or panels.
- ☁️ **Environments**: Mentioned tech environments (e.g., Stage, Production).
- 📲 **Software**: Discussed tools or platforms.

### 3. **Markdown as the Foundation:**
OpenMeetingLog utilizes Markdown for structuring the records. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that simplifies content formatting. It's widely recognized and easy to use, making the records both human-readable and suitable for various platforms.

## 🌱 Premises for Evolution
- **Consistency:** Keep a uniform pattern across all records for easier reading and understanding.
- **Periodic Review:** Update, remove, or add information by periodically reviewing the records.
- **Team Feedback:** Actively seek feedback from team members to identify and implement improvements.
- **Adaptation:** Adjust the format as required by the specific needs of the team or project.
- **Open Source Contributions:** As an open-source project, we value and are open to community suggestions, enhancements, and contributions.
